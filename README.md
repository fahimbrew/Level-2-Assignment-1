# ðŸ›  TypeScript: Interface vs Type (Plus Union & Intersection Examples)

There are some massive differences between Interface and Type. If youâ€™ve been working with TypeScript for a while, youâ€™ve probably seen both interface and type. They both let you define shapes for objects, so itâ€™s easy to wonder â€” whatâ€™s the difference? And when should you use one over the other?

What is an interface?

An interface is used to describe the shape of an object. Itâ€™s like a blueprint that says what properties an object should have.


interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const person: User = {
  name: "Fahim",
  age: 25,
};

What is a type?

A type can also describe an object (just like an interface), but it can do more. You can use it for primitives, unions, intersections, and more.


type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

ðŸ§  When to Use Which?

Use an interface when youâ€™re defining the structure of an object or class.

Use type when you need more flexibility, like combining multiple types or creating unions.

ðŸ’¡ Tip:
If you're describing a thing â†’ use interface
If you're combining things or making choices â†’ use type

ðŸ”€ Union Type

A union type means a value can be one thing or another.

type ID = string | number;

let userId: ID = "abc123";
userId = 42; // also valid

ðŸ”— Intersection Type

An intersection type means combining multiple types into one.

type Name = { name: string };
type Age = { age: number };

type Person = Name & Age;

const user: Person = {
  name: "Tamanna",
  age: 18
};
