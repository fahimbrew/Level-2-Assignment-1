# ðŸ›  TypeScript: Interface vs Type (Plus Union & Intersection Examples)

There are some massive differences between Interface and Type. If youâ€™ve been working with TypeScript for a while, youâ€™ve probably seen both interface and type. They both let you define shapes for objects, so itâ€™s easy to wonder â€” whatâ€™s the difference? And when should you use one over the other?

ðŸ§  When to Use Which?

Use an interface when youâ€™re defining the structure of an object or class.

Use type when you need more flexibility, like combining multiple types or creating unions.

ðŸ’¡ Tip:
If you're describing a thing â†’ use interface
If you're combining things or making choices â†’ use type
